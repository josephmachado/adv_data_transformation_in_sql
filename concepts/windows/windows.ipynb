    "1. **RANGE**: Used to select a set of rows relative to the current row based on the value of the columns specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.\n",
    "    1. Range definition format `RANGE BETWEEN start_point AND end_point`.\n",
    "    2. The start_point and end_point can be any of the following:\n",
    "        1. **CURRENT ROW**: The current row.\n",
    "        2. **n PRECEDING**: All rows with values within the specified range that are less than or equal to n units preceding the value of the current row.\n",
    "        3. **n FOLLOWING**: All rows with values within the specified range that are greater than or equal to n units following the value of the current row.\n",
    "        4. **UNBOUNDED PRECEDING**: All rows before the current row within the partition.\n",
    "        5. **UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING**: All rows after the current row within the partition.\n",
    "    3. `RANGE` is particularly useful when dealing with numeric or date/time ranges, allowing for calculations like running totals, moving averages, or cumulative distributions.\n",
